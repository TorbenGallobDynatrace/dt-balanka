# DT Balanka - Table Soccer Observability

## Overview
Welcome to the DT Balanka repository, a proof of concept project developed by Team Luminux during the Dynatrace Innovation Day in January 2024 in order to take the spirit of playing table soccer at Dynatrace to a new level. Our project combines hardware and software elements to track and display game scores and player statistics for Balanka (table soccer).

## Project Components

### Hardware
- **ESP32 Device**: A compact, USB-powered, and WiFi-enabled microcontroller that forms the core of our hardware setup.
- **RFID Sensors**: Two sensors connected to the ESP32, allowing players to identify themselves using employee tags or custom RFID tags.
- **OLED Display**: 128x32px mini OLED display.
- **Connectivity**: The ESP32's WiFi capabilities are utilized to connect the hardware with our web application.
- **Buttons**: Four simple buttons for user input.

### Software
- **ESP32 Arduino App**: Arduino C++ application for the ESP32 and the sensors using the VSCode PlatformIO plugin.
- **Supabase Backend**: Our backend infrastructure is built on Supabase, ensuring robust data management and seamless integration with our frontend.
- **React Frontend**: A user-friendly web application developed using React, showcasing game results and detailed player statistics.
- **PHP Supabase Proxy**: As we did not know if the used HTTP library on the ESP32 will support HTTPS, we build a simple PHP API proxy (which wouldn't have been needed).

## Features

- **Player Identification**: Utilizes RFID technology for player authentication and identification.
- **Score Tracking**: Players can input scores directly through the hardware interface, which are then reflected on the web application.
- **Game Management**: The display and buttons on the device enable players to start games, enter scores, and submit them to the backend.
- **Statistical Insights**: The web application provides statistics and insights about game performances, scores, and player rankings.

# User Interface and process

- Mini display with 4 Buttons
- 5 Screens
  - **Welcome** (fetching player list over REST call)
  - **Register Players** (switch between players 1-4, hold tag near RFID scanner to identify, proceed to team overview when ready)
  - **Team Overview** (confirm team configuration or go back)
  - **Scores** (show and set team scores)
  - **Submit Scores?** (confirm or go back)
  - **Submission result** (success or error screen, any key goes back to welcome)
