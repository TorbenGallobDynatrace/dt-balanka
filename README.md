# DT Balanka - Table Soccer Observability

## Overview
Welcome to the DT Balanka repository, a project developed during the Dynatrace Innovation Day in January 2024 in order to take the spirit of playing table soccer at Dynatrace to a new level. Our project combines hardware and software elements to track and display game scores and player statistics in real-time.

## Project Components

### Hardware
- **ESP32 Device**: A compact, USB-powered, and WiFi-enabled microcontroller that forms the core of our hardware setup.
- **RFID Sensors**: Two sensors connected to the ESP32, allowing players to identify themselves using employee tags or custom RFID tags.
- **eInk Display**: A 2.7" WaveShare eInk display equipped with four buttons, providing an interactive interface for players.
- **Connectivity**: The ESP32's WiFi capabilities are utilized to connect the hardware with our web application.

### Software
- **Supabase Backend**: Our backend infrastructure is built on Supabase, ensuring robust data management and seamless integration with our frontend.
- **React Frontend**: A user-friendly web application developed using React, showcasing game results and detailed player statistics.

## Features

- **Player Identification**: Utilizes RFID technology for player authentication and identification.
- **Real-Time Score Tracking**: Players can input scores directly through the hardware interface, which are then reflected in real-time on the web application.
- **Game Management**: The eInk display and buttons on the device enable players to start games, enter scores, and submit them to our backend.
- **Statistical Insights**: The web application provides comprehensive statistics and insights about game performances, scores, and player rankings.

# User Interface

- 2.7" eInk display with 4 Buttons
- Screen shows initial welcome message
- Button 1: Reset the game. Players can identify and register themselves for teams A and B and names will be shown on the display accordingly. Missing identities will be anonymous players.
- Button 2: Increase score of team A, 0 to 10, then go back to 0
- Button 3: Increase score of team B, 0 to 10, then go back to 0
- Button 4: Pressed once questions to submit the current score, press again to submit the score to Supabase
